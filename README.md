This is our custom for our media server based on the Jellyfin-vue client. It will get regular updates, whenever they are pushed at origin. Aside from that, we will also add our own changes:

- Cosmetic changes to align with the sluthub branding
- Preferential changes like sortings or excludes for certain media-types
- Small logic fixes that wont affect the end-user, and wont make merging complicated

You can check for all those changes [here](https://github.com/Sluthub/sluthub-vue/commits/master/?author=ClaraCrazy)
